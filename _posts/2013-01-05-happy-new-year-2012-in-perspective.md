####Another Year Gone
So another year has come and gone, 2012 was probably the worst year for me so far in my professional career, where I changed job hoping that it would be for the best...but it turned out that it wasn't. Although, there were some highlights through out the later part of the year, but more on that later.

####Moving On To Bigger And Better Things
At the end of 2011 I decided that I had had enough of the upper management team at my then current job, I didn't feel that they were fulfilling the expectations they were setting and not investing in their people and compromising the quality of the work that we were producing.

So I set out to find a new challenge in my career, I had a friend that was working for one of our government departments and he told me there was a position open for a developer to work on one of the bigger application used by this department. I thought this sounded just like something that I would enjoy working on so I applied for the job, and a few days later I went for an interview with them and the next day they called me back and offered me the position, which I accepted.

Informing my then team leader and manager was one of the toughest things I have had to do as I was really enjoying the people that I was working with, both in my team and the other teams within the software development department.

####New Beginnings
When I started my new job, the application I would be working on had just had a major release deployed to production and there were some major work still in the pipeline that would make a big impact on the usability of the application for the business. It started off really well with lots of interesting and challenging work, as it was a totally new system (that is massive) to me, I was enjoying this new challenge, but after about 6 months, things took a turn for the worse...cost cutting, staff reduction, projects cancelled, no new work unless approved by high up managers that was holding on to their money like there was no tomorrow.

####Where Did It All Go Wrong?
Instead of having us work on fixing bugs and making the application more usable to our clients, management had us working on documenting the system as a whole so that if needed the development/support of the application could be outsourced. Yay, write documentation so that they can replace us...:/

In the end I decided that enough is enough, I am wasting away my career in this position and I am not learning anything, except how to write documentation, and falling further and further behind with the progress of the technologies that I am working with. So I decided that I was going to find a new job that would allow me to work with more recent technologies and at least be able to progress my knowledge and skills. I went for a couple of interviews but without success, and since then I haven't spotted anything that tickled my fancy.

####The Good Bits For The Year
At about the same time as I started looking for a new job a saw a developer who was looking for someone to help him write a WPF application for an OSS project he was involved with, as I had been thinking about getting into the OSS scene as a way to improve my skills and get greater exposure to new technologies I put my hand up to help him with this WPF application.

Since then I have helped out on a couple of other OSS projects and also started working on a few projects of my own in my spare time.

####What The Future Holds
And now that it is 2013, I have set a couple of new years resolutions for myself to get involved more in the OSS world, and to learn a number of new technologies through it the year. All while trying to find a new job that can challenge me and make feel like I want to go to work because it doesn't feel like work.
