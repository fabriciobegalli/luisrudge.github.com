####New Years Resolution #4 - Start blogging!
So I made a resolution this year to start blogging again, this is my **third(!)** attempt to start this thing now, so let's hope for three's a charm.

####The Not So Easy Start
A while back I signed up with a hosting company that provided functionality to use different blogging platforms, like Wordpress or BlogEngine.NET, this was handy as it meant one click installation to get up and running but the issue, for me at least, was that customising the blog design was more effort than I felt like it was worth.

####The Easier Way
Then I found out about [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com "Github Pages") from [buildstarted](http://buildstarted.com "Buildstarted"), [Adam Ralph](http://adamralph.com "Adam Ralph") and [Phillip Haydon](http://www.philliphaydon.com "Phillip Haydon"). After reading about how Github Pages works and how you can create pages and posts that all use the same layout and design, I decided to create one of my own and started off by using one of their built-in templates and then redesign it to my liking.

####The Redesign
The redesign of the layout and theme was so much simpler as the structure of a Github Pages site simply consists of a default layout page, a post layout page (if you want to create a site that displays posts) and then a file for each page that you want to have on your site, all these pages can be straight HTML if you just want to create a site with static information on it, although, as all pages contained within your site gets processed by [jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll "jekyll"), 
> a simple, blog aware, static site generator, 

you can included [YAML Front Matter](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/template-data) tags to extract information about your site that is made available via the [Liquid templating system](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/liquid-extensions).

####The Verdict (so far)
Before I started using Github Pages, I spent a lot of time (weeks) trying to redesign the themes for both Wordpress (not a big fan of PHP) and BlogEngine.NET, I started using Github Pages less than a day ago, and already the layout is (mostly) finished, and up and running. They also make the deployment of your new site and posts super simple, just commit your changes to your Github Repo and they will build and deploy your changes to your site (almost) instantly.

####Things Still To Complete 
- Comments
- about page
- projects page
- all the things I've forgotten or not thought of yet!

####Finally
I'd like to give a big thanks to [buildstarted](http://buildstarted.com), [Adam Ralph](http://adamralph.com "Adam Ralph") and [Phillip Haydon](http://www.philliphaydon.com "Phillip Haydon") for letting me steal their ideas to get up and running with my own Gihub Pages blog!
